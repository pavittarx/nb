nb (short for notes;book)

This is a personal project aimed at storing my notes using Markdown. 

The immediate goal is to migrate my notes from Notion, while not loosing any rendering capabilities, that requires a robust view layer to be built. 
Editing can be done any text based editor since, markdown files are simply text files. 

## What tech does this use? 
- [React Remix](https://remix.run/)
- [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) 
- [Katex](https://katex.org/docs/browser.html) 
- [Custom Web Components](https://web.dev/articles/custom-elements-v1)

## Why this project? 
My collection of notes has been growing and while I have been using [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to manage this, but I do not see it as viable long term solution. 

### What I like about notion? 
- Cross Platform (Web, Windows, Mac, Linux)
- Nice UI, that allows to arrange your notes the way you want. 
- Your notes are on the cloud so those are always sync. No worries about uploading or saving. 
- Multiple Collaborators

## Why I want to move on?
- Becomes slow, and hard to load at times.
- Does not handle very large files. 
- Options for export are available, but it will be very hard to move if I have a lot of data. 
- Significant costs, if you start to go premium. Workspaces are charged seprately for each member you add to the workspace. 
- Notion Databases are very slow. 
- The choice of fonts is limited, especially Latex fonts are hard to read or work with.
- More control on my data, and what can be done. 

I have liked Notion a lot since I came to understand it. I has allowed me to streamline my note taking process. However, I do not see it as a long term viable solution.
